# setup
This project is created with [convex](https://www.convex.dev/) along with [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), so If you want to use this project locally, follow these steps:-

- clone this repository and visit the directory

```bash
  pnpm i 
```
- Since I'm using Convex for my backend option, you will need to head over to [convex](https://www.convex.dev/)  and create a free account, and then head over to your terminal again and run the following:
1. to initialize the project
```bash
  pnpm dlx convex dev
```
follow the step guide you will find in your terminal.
2. when ever you create an update or a change, you will need to run that command each time.
